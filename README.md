# Frank-Kane-s-Taming-Big-Data-with-Apache-Spark-and-Python
These are examples from "Frank Kane's Taming Big Data with Apache Spark and Python" book which covers Apache Spark in detail from basic fundamentals to advanced ML libraries. I have included the code and dataset here in the github. Please reach out to me if you face any issues while going through code.
